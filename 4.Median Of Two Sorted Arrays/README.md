# Median of Two Sorted Arrays
>Python
# Introduction

>* The findMedianSortedArrays method in this Python class (Solution) calculates the median of two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2.
>* It takes two input lists, sorts them, and then calculates the median based on the sorted merged array.
# How It Works
>The findMedianSortedArrays method in the Solution class:
>* Accepts two sorted arrays as input (nums1 and nums2).
>* Merges the two arrays into one sorted array.
>* Calculates the median of the merged array and returns it.
>* The program uses basic sorting and mathematical calculations to find the median.
